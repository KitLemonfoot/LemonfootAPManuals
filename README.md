# LemonfootAPManuals
This is a repository for manual APworlds that I haven't released to the Archipelago community.
This is so I can submit them on async forms without needing to formally publish them.

Many of these games require hacked save files or cheat to operate as intended. Please see each release tag for specifics.

Most all of these were created with the [Manual for Archipelago Builder](https://manualforarchipelago.github.io/ManualBuilder/).
